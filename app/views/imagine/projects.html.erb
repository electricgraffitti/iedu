				<h2>The First Socially Networked Math Game</h2>

					Story-based, strategic and collaborative, Empires will set an entirely new standard in educational gaming. Players are cast in the role of a leader of an ancient Mesopotamian empire, and find themselves consistently using pre-algebra in a meaningful context, as they tax their population, allocate resources, trade goats and barter with their fellow students for resources from food to water supplies.
